1. How do I approach designing software?
      I typically start by obtaining clear requirements for the software. I then try to create a rough plan of breaking down the different components needed. designing this 3D scene improved my understanding of lighting, texturing, and different rendering techniques. For my future work I think involving users in the design process would help refine the software's design. 
3. How do I approach developing programs?
      similar to my approach to designing software, I like to understand the requirements so that I may break down the project into smaller well defined components. There is alot of iteration during my development. I think iteration is crucial because it allows you to incorporate feedback and refine code. 
4. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
      Computer Science helps me reach my goals by improving my problem solving and critical thinking. It gives me the skills to break down problems and create my own innovative solutions.
This course has given me knowledge about the various applications computer graphics can be applied to. This knowledge could help me in future professional fields such as animations studios, visual effects, virtual reality, and game developments to name a few.
